## Hardware

- **Apple Macbook Pro 15 (2019)**: Standard work issue Macbook Pro. 16GB RAM paired with dedicated GPU.
- **Apple Macbook Pro 13 (2018)**: Personal MBP with 8GB RAM. A comfy size for travel and Netflix.
- **Keychron K2 Keyboard**: Nice mechanical keyboard with Mac layout and Cherry MX Brown switches.
- **Apple iPhone 11**: Using it over 3 years. Still usable with no issues and latest OS updates.
- **Apple Airpods Pro**: Best for listening to music while working, relaxing and whatever the mood is.
- **Bose QC 35II**: Use it for work meetings. All day comfort with excellent noise cancellation.
- **Dell 24" 1080p Monitor**: I opted for 24" instead of 27" with 1080p. Does the job with decent sharpness.
- **Raspberry Pi 4 8GB**: Runs personal git, nextcloud and bunch of self-hosted services.

## Software

- **nix**: Most of my machines runs nix in some capacity. macOS machines uses nix package manager.
- **nixOS**: Raspberry Pi and Oracle VM uses nixOS. I love the declarative nature to setup the machine.
- **tmux**: This is the first program that I run in the terminal. Paired with Alacritty for my `pty` needs.
- **zsh**: Primary shell of choice. Like the customisation options with it alongside the POSIX compatibility.
- **Alacritty**: Terminal emulator of choice. Using it since 2019 and not had a single issue.
- **Code Font**: [IBM Plex Mono](https://www.ibm.com/plex/) for Editor and Term.
