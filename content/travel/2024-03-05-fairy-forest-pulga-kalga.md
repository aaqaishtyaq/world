In the heart of Himachal's Parvati Valley lie its hidden gems: Pulga and Kalga. Picture-perfect villages embraced by towering mountains, where every corner tells a story of nature's magnificence. Here, snow-capped peaks stand tall, kissing the sky, while icy waterfalls dance down the slopes, painting the landscape with their pure, untamed beauty. Despite the biting cold, every moment feels like a warm embrace from Mother Nature herself. It's not just a trip; it's a journey of awe, wonder, and connection with the raw essence of the mountains.
