Scrapy is good for scraping static web pages using python but when it comes to dynamic web pages scrapy can't do wonders, and there comes ```Selenium``` but as good as selenium is, it just got beaten by Scrapy in terms or speed.

Web nowdays is all about Dynamic JS based pages and AJAX. So for this very scenario the guys over [scrapy-plugins][0] created ```scrapy-splash```.
Scrapy-Splash is a plugin that connects Scrapy with Splash (Lightweight, scriptable browser as a service with an HTTP API).
In a nutshell what splash do is it traps the response recieved from the server and renders it. Then it return a ```render.html``` which is static and can be easily scraped.

## 0 - Setting up the machine

A. Before we begin you need to install ```Docker``` first, You can follow the [official instruction][1] as per your Operating System.

B. After installing docker navigate to your project folder, activate ```virtualenv``` and install scrapy-splsh plugin

```bash
pip3 install scrapy-splash
```

C. Pull the Splash Docker Image and run it

```bash
docker pull scrapinghub/splash
docker run -p 8050:8050 scrapinghub/splash
```

## 1 - Configuration

A. Add the Splash server address to ```settings.py``` of your Scrapy project like this:

```python
SPLASH_URL = 'http://localhost:8050'
```
If you are running docker on your local machine then you can simply use ```http://localhost:<port>``` , but if you are running it on a remote machine you need to specify it's I.P. Address like this ```http://192.168.59.103:<port>```


B. Enable the Splash middleware by adding it to ```DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES``` in your ```settings.py``` file and changing HttpCompressionMiddleware priority:

```python
DOWNLOADER_MIDDLEWARES = {
    'scrapy_splash.SplashCookiesMiddleware': 723,
    'scrapy_splash.SplashMiddleware': 725,
    'scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.httpcompression.HttpCompressionMiddleware': 810,
}
```


C. Enable SplashDeduplicateArgsMiddleware by adding it to SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES in your settings.py:

```python
SPIDER_MIDDLEWARES = {
    'scrapy_splash.SplashDeduplicateArgsMiddleware': 100,
}
```


D. Set a custom DUPEFILTER_CLASS:

```python
DUPEFILTER_CLASS = 'scrapy_splash.SplashAwareDupeFilter'
```

## 2 - Scraping with Splash

Before you use ```scrapy-splash``` you need to import it in your spider.
You can do that by adding this line:

```python
from scrapy_splash import SplashRequest
```

from now on insted of using ```scrapy.Request``` you can simply use ```SplashRequest``` to get response from ```Splash``` insted of directly from ther server.

## Bonus - Using Scrapy-Splash in Shell

It's all well and good but actual spider buiding does not happens in ```vim``` or ```sublime```, it takes place in ```shell```.

**So how to use Splash in the shell?**

Good Question.

Insted of invoking shell with:

```bash
scrapy shell
>>> fetch(http://domain.com/page-with-javascript.html)
```
or with this:

```bash
scrapy shell http://domain.com/page-with-javascript.html
```

**You invoke shell with this**:

```bash
scrapy shell 'http://localhost:8050/render.html?url=http://domain.com/page-with-javascript.html&timeout=10&wait=0.5'
```

Let me explain

* ```localhost:port``` is where your splash service is running
* ```url``` is url you want to crawl
* ```render.html``` is one of the possible http api endpoints, returns redered html page in this case
* ```timeout``` time in seconds for timeout
* ```wait``` time in seconds to wait for javascript to execute before reading/saving the html.
