It's about chatbots. I don't care about chatbots, I care about free stickers and pizza. So I'll take this opportunity to open up about a subject that's dear to my heart: vim.<p>I used to believe vim was exclusive to this superior race of developers who gulp coffee like it's water and seem to only read HN and nothing else. (Hi, if you're coming from HN). Architecture and Software design comes naturally to them, they never run into bugs and they can recognize the most obscure of algorithms at a glance (Shout out to Shashank, one of my mentors).<p>Shanky is a good, productive developer. Shany uses vim. I want to be like Shanky. I want to use vim.<p>There are a million reasons why you should jump ship and join the cult. In the next paragraphs, I will detail some of these reasons.<h2 id=it-s-not-that-hard>It's not (that) hard</h2><p>There's a learning curve to vim. But it's worth the trouble. And if you're on Linux or MacOS, there's a built-in tool called <code>vimtutor</code> (just fire it up from a terminal, I am not sure about Windows though) and a wide variety of online tools to learn vim. Namely <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=http://www.openvim.com/ target=_blank>openvim</a>, <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://vim-adventures.com/ target=_blank>vim adventures</a>, and <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=http://www.vimgenius.com/ target=_blank>vim genius</a>.<p>Personally, The way I learned was by using it on small, fun side projects of mine during the weekends, mostly to become familiar with the new mental model. And just like everything in life, shit takes time, and practice makes perfect. So keep at it and you'll eventually come to your "aha" moment. As you get more and more comfortable using vim, it will become harder and harder to go back to a regular editor / IDE.<h2 id=it-s-fast-and-customisable>It's Fast and Customisable</h2><p>Because it runs on the terminal, you'll never have to wait 20 seconds to get on with your work. (Atom anyone ?)<p>And if you like pretty things, there's a <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=http://vimcolors.com/ target=_blank>large selection of colorschemes</a> for you to choose from. On top of that, there's a plugin for just about anything you might need. And if there isn't, you can program your own.<h2 id=ubiquity>Ubiquity</h2><p>Not really, but I wanted to place a complicated word to sound smart. Seriously though, it's everywhere. On Mac OS, Windows and of course Linux/Unix. If you work on remote servers you can quickly edit files on the fly without having to use nano. (Don't use nano)<p>Say for example a coworker/friend is running into a bug, you come to help and they're using an IDE you're not familiar with, well you can just access the files from their terminal and start debugging right away.<p>Or if you're like me, and you spill water on your Macbook keyboard and it becomes toast, you can spin up a VPS on Digital Ocean or AWS, and pick up where you left off (almost) right away.<h2 id=bonus-some-of-my-favorite-plugins>Bonus: Some of my favorite plugins</h2><p>My color scheme of choice (at the time of writing) is <a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/danilo-augusto/vim-afterglow target=_blank>afterglow</a>.<p>And here's a list of my favorite plugins:<ul><li><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/scrooloose/nerdtree target=_blank> Nerdtree </a> (A tree explorer much like the sidebar in traditional IDEs)<li><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/vim-airline/vim-airline target=_blank> Airline </a> (A sleek, customizable status bar)<li><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround target=_blank> Surround </a> (Helpful tool that helps with "surrounding" words with brackets etc)<li><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/kien/ctrlp.vim target=_blank> CtrlP </a> (A fuzzy finder for vim)<li><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips target=_blank> UtilSnips </a> (Snippet utility for many languages)<li><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown target=_blank> Vim Markdown</a> (Markdown syntax highlighting)<li><a rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer" href=https://github.com/junegunn/goyo.vim target=_blank> Goyo </a> (Allows for distraction-free editing)</ul><p>I'll end this article with a quote from a Chamillionaire:<blockquote><p>They see you vimmin', they hatin'.
